        "article": "As the cryptocurrency market keeps fluctuating, Chainlink (LINK) and Near Protocol (NEAR) are experiencing different trends, with LINK under pressure and NEAR enjoying a rise. Amid these ups and downs,\nBlockDAG (BDAG)\nstands out with its strong presale performance, enhanced by a generous 100% bonus offer using the code BDAG100\u2014available for a limited time.\nUnlike LINK\u2019s difficulties and NEAR\u2019s brief increase, BlockDAG\u2019s steady growth, nearing $100 million in presale funds, shows a more solid chance. With prices expected to rise soon, this limited-time offer provides a timely benefit for those wanting to buy.\nChainlink Users Are Losing Big Money\nChainlink (LINK) has seen small increases, up 1.35% for the month and 0.69% for the week, currently at $10.64. However, it is generally on a downward trend, struggling to keep up its momentum. Its price has dropped below a crucial pattern, hinting at a possible fall to $8, where it might find some support.\nMoreover, indicators like the MACD suggest increasing downward pressure, and the Stochastic RSI shows LINK is oversold, likely leading to more drops. Also, data shows 86% of active addresses are losing money, adding to the selling pressure.\nHowever, there is a bit of hope in the positive Open Interest-Weighted Funding Rates (0.0083%), which offer some possibility of recovery. Still, overall market conditions suggest a drop to $8 might happen before any rebound.\nBlockDAG Batch 26 Is Nearly Here\u2014Catch the 100% Bonus Befor Prices Rise!\nRight now, BlockDAG is making big waves in the cryptocurrency market with its standout presale results, quickly nearing an amazing $110 million milestone. In a very short time, this initiative has built a strong base, collecting over $107.5 million and seeing a 2100% increase in BDAG coin value\u2014from a simple $0.001 to an impressive $0.0206. This growth shows a deep change in how people are getting involved, bringing over 170,000 unique holders into the community.\nAlso, the recent 100% bonus offer for both new and current participants using the code BDAG100 has sparked even more interest. But this offer won\u2019t last long being a limited-time and exclusive gift to the community. This is a prime time for those looking to grow their holdings. With each batch that sells out, BDAG\u2019s price is set to rise further, making now a great time to get in.\nWhat\u2019s more, the quick $10 million raised in just 72 hours highlights the community\u2019s strong belief in BlockDAG\u2019s future. As the latest batch gets close to selling out, the excitement suggests we\u2019re at the start of a much bigger story. Analysts even predict a BDAG price could reach $30 by 2030, which would mean huge benefits for early participants.\nSo, if you\u2019re still thinking it over, it\u2019s time to make a move. As we count down to batch 26 opening, grabbing this 100% bonus means not just joining a thriving venture but being part of a pioneering shift in finance. As BlockDAG nears the major milestone of $110 million, the future looks bright, promising big returns and major breakthroughs in the crypto market.\nNear Protocol\u2019s Strong Performance\nSimilarly, Near Protocol had a strong trading day, with a significant 8.4% increase, bringing its price to $5.22. This price boost came with a 170% rise in trading volume over 24 hours, indicating a lot of traders are getting involved with NEAR. The protocol has recently shown signs of a possible change in its price trend.\nOver the past month, Near Protocol has increased by 42% in value, solidifying its strong performance. Additionally, its annual gains are impressive, rising over 377%. Just a year ago, NEAR was trading at just over $1. This current surge is a vivid example of how holding investments long-term can lead to substantial rewards, as those who stayed with NEAR have seen large returns.\nLast Call\nWhile Chainlink faces downturns and Near Protocol sees quick spikes, typical of the market\u2019s ups and downs, BlockDAG\u2019s presale is moving steadily upward. With $107.5 million already gathered and the 100% bonus offer, BlockDAG stands out as a chance for those looking for long-term growth.\nWith batch 26 approaching, there\u2019s a short window left to seize the bonus before the price goes up.\nJoin BlockDAG Presale Now:\nWebsite:\nhttps://blockdag.network\nPresale:\nhttps://purchase.blockdag.network\nTelegram:\nhttps://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\nDiscord:\nhttps://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\nThis publication is sponsored.

These updates aim to simplify cross-chain interactions and improve dApp efficiency.\nChain Signatures for Multi-Chain Access\nThe Chain Signatures feature makes it possible to use one account to handle multiple blockchains; in this way, blockchain complexity is reduced by not necessarily managing your separate wallets for each chain.\nWith account and identity management consolidated on NEAR, the experience of interacting with multiple blocks becomes much simpler. The goal is to simplify and make NEAR more accessible to a broader audience. It is to help them manage multichains.\n- Advertisement -\nThe token also introduces Keypom\u2019s trial accounts that allow users to sign up with a single click and provide an easy way into the token ecosystem.\nThe Trial Account Manager interface gives you the option to change account settings like the number of accounts, the number of chains allowed, and the allowed contracts. It also affords more adaptability, and alternative account management by supporting diverse user needs.\nSource: X\nSuch security mechanisms are robust enough to prevent users from using sponsored applications to commit subversive activities, including \u2018rug pulling\u2019. By improving overall trust and safety for users within the NEAR ecosystem, this.\nREVOX Integration Enhances NEAR\u2019s Web3 Capabilities\nAs a part of its plan to broaden out its Web3 functionality, NEAR Protocol has joined forces with REVOX to assist in bringing in Lense and Smart Wallet.\nThis partnership with REVOX further solidifies NEAR infrastructure by supplying developers with a means to build on a robust & scalable network and create\ndecentralized apps\n(dApps). The token will integrate with Proof of Stake consensus and sharding technology to deliver high throughput.\nFor example, users can connect their wallets and jump into the NEAR-powered ecosystem through REVOX\u2019s Lense platform for a more streamlined, more accessible Web3 experience.\nThis further complements the token focus on AI and chain abstraction, making it a smoother and more flexible experience for users to transition from one Web3 app to another.\nSource: X\nThis is a vital step toward creating dApps. It extends NEAR\u2019s fold to a large user population aimed at a wide range of dApp use cases. It is something that matches precisely the Web3 industry\u2019s burgeoning dynamics.\nNear Protocol Price Outlook: Is a Breakout Ahead?\nThese improvements and strategic integrations look good for its growth as well as the potential for price reversal.\nThe NEAR/USD chart indicates a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern.\u00a0 Breaking above the $6 resistance level would be a bullish sign for NEAR. It which suggests the asset could undertake a 130% significant upward move from the current price.\nNEAR\nhas not been immune to volatility this year. Its price peaked at 8.9 in early 2024 before dropping 65%.\u00a0From that peak, it went to a low of $3.06. However, Near has recovered by 30% to currently trade at $4.35 with a 2.5% decrease in the last 24 hours.\nSource: Tradingview\nAdding the Money Flow Index (MFI) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) to the chart gives depth to the analysis.\nWith MFI at 37, the token appears to be close to oversold territory. It looks open to a buying opportunity if bullishness resumes. Also, with the RSI sitting at 42, the idea of possible reversal is also supported by the possibility of crossing the 50 mark.\nDisclaimer\nThe contents of this page are intended for general informational purposes and do not constitute financial, investment, or any other form of advice.

The hacker, not yet identified, exploited the popularity of the account to publish a series of hate messages towards the crypto and web3 sector.\nStrangely, the community did not lose any funds as no malicious link and no scam token contract address were published by the attacker.\nIt is not the first time that Near Protocol has experienced a similar security incident: in May, its X profile had previously been compromised in a similar modus operandi.\nLet\u2019s see all the details below.\nSummary\nUnusual hacker attack on the X account of the Near Protocol project\nLast night the official X profile of Near Protocol was hacked by an individual who still has not been identified.\nThis is a particularly unusual attack\n, as it seems that the user\u2019s intent was not to fraudulently enrich themselves by exploiting the account\u2019s 1.8 million followers.\nIn fact, in a time span of about 1 hour during which the project\u2019s profile was compromised, no malicious link, malware, or\nphishing\ncampaign was published.\nAt the beginning, it was even thought that it was not a hack, but merely a marketing move by the Near Protocol team\nwith the goal of attracting engagement.\nSubsequently, the hack was confirmed, but no funds were stolen from the community of the\nblockchain\nof type L1.\nScreenshot of a post published by the hacker, now removed. Source:\nhttps://x.com/NEARProtocol\nIt seems that the hacker\u2019s goal was to spread discontent or to troll the crypto community with hate messages\ntowards the\nweb3\nsector.\nThe username of the Near account was renamed to \u201c\nit\u2019s all a lie\n\u201d, while the bio listed all the web3 scam projects with a link to\nCoinMarketCap\n.\nFrom the subsequently published posts, the playful spirit of the attacker was evident, who continued to mock the major crypto projects.\nBy retweeting, for example, a post from\nMetaMask\n, the hacker advised all users of the wallet to seek psychiatric mental support.\nSource:\nhttps://x.com/NEARProtocol\nIn another post, he mocked the information site Coindesk, which promptly reported the news of the hack.\nAgain,\nthe joker hesitated about the virility of crypto enthusiasts by posting a photo depicting a vial of liquid testosterone.\nHe recommended its use to all those who are affected by the \u201c\ncrypto mind virus\n\u201d.\nFortunately, although this episode undermines the reputation of Near Protocol, there were no violent intentions from the hacker. Not even a cent was stolen from the crypto community.\nSource:\nhttps://x.com/NEARProtocol\nThe post-mortem statement from the Near Protocol team\nA few hours after regaining control of their X profile, the Near Protocol team published a post-mortem statement of the incident.\nIn a brief message, the project insiders acknowledged and confirmed the hack\n. They highlighted the attacker\u2019s attempt to demotivate, dissuade, and criticize both Near and the entire crypto and web3 sector.\nAlthough\nthe identity\nof the subject has not been discovered,\nit is believed that behind these trolls is the well-known hacker \u201c\nfour chan\n\u201d\n. He is known for his frequent\nhacks\nfor trolling purposes, where he enjoys mocking his victims and the followers of the victims.\nIt is not clear how the profile was technically compromised but the Near team stated that the\nsecurity\nflaw has been isolated.\nMike Rotch, IT expert and head of the security team, led the operation restoring the correct control of the social media.\nA statement from the NEAR Ecosystem regarding today's events.\npic.twitter.com/3GeQCafN5d\n\u2014 NEAR Protocol (@NEARProtocol)\nSeptember 4, 2024\nDespite this story not involving cases of theft or scam, it is clear that the attack still casts a bad light on the work of Near Protocol in terms of security.\nIt is also not the first time that one\u2019s social account has been compromised: in May, in fact, another similar case occurred.\nNot even on that occasion were funds stolen from users, while coded \u201c\ndarkness\n\u201d messages were published.\nThrough a grotesque style and with strange text fonts, messages had emerged that quoted:\n\u201cthe sun rises in the east\u201d, \u201ctake back your thoughts\u201d\n, and \u201c\nreclaim your sovereignty\n\u201d.\nThere is a good chance that the hacker troll \u201cfour chan\u201d is responsible for both hacks.\nThe problem of social profile hacks in the crypto world: some practical advice\nThe case of the hack of the X profile of Near Protocol, despite there being no serious consequences, underscores an underlying problem of the entire crypto world.\nOften malicious users (much more than \u201c\nfour chan\n\u201d) specifically target the social profiles of cryptographic projects\nwith the intent of leveraging their popularity and credibility to steal money from less attentive users.\nMore and more often similar cases have repeated, with most occasions where the hacker publishes a post with a\nmalicious link\nthat directs to a fraudulent\ndapp\n.\nOften in these attacks, reference is made to certain\nlanci di\nairdrop\nin progress (obviously fake), as a tactic to attract as much traffic as possible to the fake links.\nOther times the\n\u201c\ncontract\naddress\n\u201d (ca) of a token\nis published, which has been previously purchased massively by the hacker, and which will be dumped after pushing the community to buy it. In the worst cases, these tokens are \u201c\nhoneypot\n\u201d, meaning they only allow purchasing and not selling by users, except for the code developer.\nIn short, there are various tactics that malicious individuals exploit to mislead the followers of a crypto project.\nIn most cases, fortunately, only a few million or a few hundred thousand dollars are stolen, while the most lucrative hacks occur\non-chain\n.\nOn social media, there is an attempt to play on the inexperience of the audience, with newcomers struggling to distinguish a fake post from a scammer from a real one published by the team.\nThe advice we can give is to always perform a double check on X\nwhen encountering \u201cstrange\u201d posts or when discussing tokens and airdrops.\n99% of the time, if there is truly a legit airdrop happening, everyone will be talking about it and you can be sure that (by following the right accounts) you will recognize it instantly.\nNever click on links published on X without a preliminary check on other platforms, especially if from unknown accounts. Additionally, it is advisable to\ninstall a security extension\n, which identifies possible fraudulent smart contracts, such as \u201c\nwallet guard\n\u201d.\nIn this way, if you accidentally end up in a dapp scam, the extension will notify you.\nFor the problem of honeypots and tokens with rugpull mechanisms, the solution is not to trade\nmemecoin\n(lol).\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp\nPrevious article\nSiemens issues a digital bond worth 330 million dollars on a private blockchain: a step forward for the finance of the future\nNext article\nWhile AVAX and TON Prices Lost Over 20% Last Month, Rollblock Gained 140%\nAlessandro Adami\nGraduated in \"Information, Media and Advertising\", for over 4 years interested in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.\r\nCo-Founder of Tokenparty, community active in spreading crypto-enthusiasm.
