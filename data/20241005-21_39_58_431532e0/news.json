In particular, the analyst notes that each time the Fear and Greed Index reached the fear level since 2023, Bitcoin\u2019s price has formed a bottom, i.e. reached the lowest point during a price decline, and is set for price reversal.Notably, Bitcoin already showed an upward movement on Friday after starting October with a price decline. However, it cannot be said that the price bottom has now occurred as Bitcoin\u2019s daily chart shows the asset is still far above its next significant support level following months of consolidation between $55,000 \u2013 70,000.Although, if the premier cryptocurrency has bottomed out, it could be heading for a price breakout in line with popular expectations for abullish \u201cuptober\u201d.
