Although liquidations reflect significant selling activity and investor losses, they can also signal pivotal shifts in market sentiment.The CryptoQuant analyst noted that periods of severe losses and market liquidations often lead to the formation of local price bottoms. \u201cDuring significant price declines, the number of contracts purchased tends to drop sharply due to liquidations, which reduces selling pressure in the market,\u201d Caueconomy said.Furthermore, the analyst mentioned that the price of Bitcoin might be gearing up for a short-term recovery due to the reduced selling pressure. However, Caueconomy highlighted the importance of increasing buying strength from the investors for the Bitcoin price to make a full comeback.Bitcoin Price At A GlanceIt does appear like the price of Bitcoin established a local bottom around the psychological $60,000 level before a pivotal rebound.
