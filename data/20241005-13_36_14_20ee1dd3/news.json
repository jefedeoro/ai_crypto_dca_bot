These whales likely believe that the bull is far from over, which is why they haven\u2019t secured as much profit as they have done inprevious bull runs.Bitcoin Whales Have Taken Lesser Profits In This Market Cycle Than Past OnesKi Young Ju mentioned in an X post that if the Bitcoin bull cycle were to end here, it would mean that Bitcoin whales have just set the record for the least profit-taking across all cycles ever.Crypto analyst Ali Martineztried to counter Ki Young Ju\u2019s point by highlighting how these whales have been distributing their BTC across different addresses, leading to a drop in the number of addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC.Related Reading\u2018FLOKI Master Plan\u2019: Crypto Analyst Predicts 2,000% Jump For The Shiba Inu Competitor21 hours agoSource: XHowever,the CryptoQuant founderclaimed that this is still the lowest return rate across all cycles, no matter how much these whales sold through those different wallets.

He remarked that one must look at more macro-level aggregated data, such as historical realized profit, rather than just transactions to get the bigger picture.These whales are believed to be holding back on taking profits just yet, considering that the bull run looks to be far from over. The CryptoQuant CEO also mentioned earlier that Bitcoin was still in the middle of a bull run based on the market cap to realized cap metric.Instead of taking profits, these Bitcoin whales are still accumulating more BTC ahead of the next leg of the bull run.CryptoQuantrecentlyrevealedthat there has been a surge in the outflows from exchanges, the largest since November 2022. Meanwhile, Ki Young Ju alsonotedthat new whales are accumulating at a rate the market has never witnessed before.When Is This Market Cycle Expected To Peak?Crypto analysts like Rekt Capitalhave predicted that theBitcoin market topcould occur sometime in mid-September or mid-October 2025. However, in arecent report, CoinMarketCap offered a different opinion, predicting that the cycle top could potentially be between mid-May and mid-June 2025.Related ReadingAnalyst Says PEPE Bearish Continuation Is Possible For A 50% Price Crash1 day agoSource: XThe platform noted thatBitcoinis currently ahead of historical trends, especially considering that it hit a newall-time high (ATH)before the Halving event.

In apress conferenceon October 3, Julie Kozack, the director of the IMF\u2019s communications department, highlighted the collaborative efforts between IMF staff and Salvadoran officials.Their goal is to complete a new program supported by the IMF, which aims to stabilize the country\u2019s economy, make necessary adjustments, and promote growth-focused reforms.However, theIMF\u2019s recommendationreflects ongoing concerns about the risks associated with Bitcoin as a legal tender. If the country acts on this advice, it could lead to a more stable economic environment, attracting foreign investment and fostering sustainable growth.IMF Continues to Hold El Salvador Hostage Over#Bitcoin, Despite:>GDP up 10%+ since adopting#Bitcoin, consistently outpacing regional peers>Murder rate down by 95%>Tourism up 95% in 2023 alone@nayibbukele, your vision is driving a remarkable transformation!Stand firm!pic.twitter.com/bk0kTkNHfQ\u2014 matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel)October 3, 2024Conversely, ignoring these recommendations may slow the country\u2019s economic recovery and introduce uncertainty into the cryptocurrency market.Ultimately, El Salvador\u2019s response to the IMF\u2019s guidance will play a crucial role in shaping its financial stability and could influence the future of cryptocurrency regulations across the region.IMF Recommends Strengthening Bitcoin Risk ManagementThe IMF stresses the importance of enhanced risk management concerningBitcoinin its ongoing discussions with El Salvador.Julie Kozack outlined several recommendations from the IMF, including narrowing the scope of El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin law, bolstering regulatory oversight, and reducing the government\u2019s exposure to Bitcoin.JUST IN: \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfbIMF calls for El Salvador to limit#Bitcoinexposurepic.twitter.com/dV2A3RhaCj\u2014 Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive)October 4, 2024These measures are intended to mitigate the potential risks of using Bitcoin as a legal tender. By taking these steps, El Salvador can work towards creating a more secure economic framework while ensuring that its approach to cryptocurrency remains responsible and sustainable.Kozack also mentioned that El Salvador\u2019s budget proposal for 2025 is a positive move toward improving public finances. If implemented effectively, these changes could lead to a more stable financial environment, encouraging investment and supporting economic growth.IMF Expresses Continued Concerns Over El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin AdoptionIt is worth recalling that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns about El Salvador\u2019s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.Following this move in September 2021, the IMF warned that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility could lead to financial instability and highlighted the lack of consumer protections in cryptocurrency transactions. They also noted that such innovations might complicate future financial assistance from the IMF.As of August 2024, while major risks had not yet occurred, the IMF continued to stress the importance of improving transparency and risk management related to Bitcoin. The agency recognized that more efforts are necessary to address potential fiscal and financial stability issues stemming from the Bitcoin initiative.Failure to heed these warnings could result in ongoing economic challenges and reduce El Salvador\u2019s chances of securing future international financial support.If the nation successfully aligns with the IMF\u2019s recommendations, it could set a global example for integrating cryptocurrencies into national economies while maintaining financial stability.Follow us on Google News"
