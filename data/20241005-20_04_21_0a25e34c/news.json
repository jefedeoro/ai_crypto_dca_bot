They also noted that such innovations might complicate future financial assistance from the IMF.As of August 2024, while major risks had not yet occurred, the IMF continued to stress the importance of improving transparency and risk management related to Bitcoin. The agency recognized that more efforts are necessary to address potential fiscal and financial stability issues stemming from the Bitcoin initiative.Failure to heed these warnings could result in ongoing economic challenges and reduce El Salvador\u2019s chances of securing future international financial support.If the nation successfully aligns with the IMF\u2019s recommendations, it could set a global example for integrating cryptocurrencies into national economies while maintaining financial stability.Follow us on Google News",
