Notably, this ETH whalehas transferredout 40,000 ETH worth $101 million since September 22, holding a balance of 99,500 ETH valued at $238 million.Generally, massive token offloads by large holders e.g. whales are interpreted as bearish signals as they indicate a lack of confidence in the asset\u2019s long-term profitability. Sales such as those seen from \u201c0xBF4\u201d may trigger a panic selling from smaller investors inducing a stronger downward pressure on Ethereum\u2019s price.Source: LookonchainRelated Reading:Crypto Capo Returns After 2 Months To Predict Ethereum Decline To $1,800, Is It Time To Go Long?108,000 ETH Moved To Exchanges In 24 HoursAside from the wallet address \u201c0xBF4\u201d, other investors have recently sold off large amounts of ETH.

This transition will be supported by increased participation fromstake pool operators(SPOs) and DReps, as well as the establishment of a Constitutional Committee (CC).Related ReadingXRP Macro Charts Signal Explosive Bullish Move Despite SEC Appeal: Analyst1 day agoThe next steps toward achieving a fully decentralized governance model involve ensuring that stake pool nodes meet operational thresholds and that decentralized applications (DApps) are nearing completion.The final transition to the Voltaire era, signifying a fully self-sustaining blockchain, will occur with the final use of the Genesis keys, triggering anotherhard fork.However, further announcements and dates for these developments have yet to be released by IOG or the blockchain\u2019s founder.The 1D chart shows ADA\u2019s price recovery experienced on Friday.

Analyst Reveals Key Levels to Watch For A $8,100 Rally2 weeks agoThe second largest digital asset by reported market cap had a 30-day annualized inflation rate of approximately 0.74%, a level not observed in the last two years. The sharp uptick in ETH supply inflation has questioned its \u201cultrasound money\u201d positioning.BitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win! Could you be next big winner?Play Now!Source:Binance ResearchInterestingly, the term \u201cultrasound money\u201d draws inspiration from Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) \u201csound money\u201d narrative. While BTC\u2019s supply is capped at 21 million, ETH\u2019s supply can become deflationary, theoretically increasing scarcity and protecting it from inflation-driven erosion of purchasing power.Ethereum\u2019s high issuance rate could be attributed to several factors, including low mainnet on-chain activity, leading to a low transaction fee and, consequently, lower ETH burn rates.In 2021, Ethereum core developers implemented EIP-1559, which introduced a fee-burning mechanism that aimed to reduce ETH\u2019s circulating supply, thereby creating deflationary pressure on the token.However, with declining mainnet activity, the amount of ETH being burned is lagging behind the ETH issuance rate, leading to a net inflationary trend.Notably, September 2024 experienced one of the lowest ETH burn rates since the highly anticipatedMergeevent, when Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions To Blame For Low ETH Burn Rate?The report points to March 2024 as the starting point of Ethereum\u2019s inflationary trend, following the implementation of EIP-4844 or theDencunupgrade, which reduced transaction costs on layer-2 scaling platforms such as Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), Base, and Polygon (MATIC). The report adds:As L2s cannibalized network activity throughout the year \u2013 further impacted by broader market conditions \u2013 transaction fees and, consequently, burned fees on Ethereum declined, with September recording one of the lowest levels since the Merge. This has prevented ETH from decreasing in supply to remain deflationary, leading to the net positive daily supply changes we now see.Recent trends corroborate the assertion above, as network activity on layer-2 solutions grows across different metrics. For instance, areportin July 2024 noted that daily active addresses and transaction volume on Polygon had soared significantly.Related ReadingEthereum Solo Staking Made Easier?

This surge was primarily driven by a broader market rally and bolstered by excitement surrounding crypto asset manager Bitwise\u2019sfilingfor an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) earlier this week.However, the enthusiasm was short-lived. XRP has since lost nearly 12% of its value on the weekly time frame, following the US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) decision toappeala partial victory for Ripple, the blockchain payments company associated with XRP.XRP Price Strength During Legal BattlesThe SEC\u2019s appeal has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, raising concerns about the future of XRP and its regulatory status. Market expert Bobby A addressed these concerns in a recentsocial media post, arguing that the macro charts do not indicate the onset of a prolonged bear market for the XRP price due to the appeal.BitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win!

For example, during the SEC lawsuit that began in 2020, XRP was able to rise from $0.11 to $1.95 despite significant legal headwinds.Bobby A emphasizes that the XRP price has been consolidating sideways for nearly seven years, indicating a strong macro base that could pave the way for future price appreciation.No Indications Of A Bear MarketFrom atechnical analysisperspective, Bobby A highlights that the monthly time frame for the XRP price reveals critical patterns. Following Bitcoin\u2019s Halving cycles, XRP has historically experienced rapid price surges during cyclical rotations of momentum oscillators. This pattern was evident in previous years, particularly in 2017 and 2020.Moreover, the Bollinger Bands\u2014a technical indicator that measures market volatility\u2014are currently at their tightest levels in XRP\u2019s history. The expert suggests that tightBollinger Bandsoften precede significant price movements, which can be \u201cdeceptive at first,\u201d as they may initially mislead market participants.Bobby A argues that current market conditions should not be misinterpreted as the start of a bear market.
