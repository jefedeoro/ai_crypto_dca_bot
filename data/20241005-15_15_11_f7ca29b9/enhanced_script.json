    "text": "Ha! Thanks, Dana. Always need a reality check. So, Beth, what's the first news item you've got for us?",
    "voice_id": "man1"
  },
  {
    "text": "Well, Alex, there's a fascinating piece out there titled 'Bitcoin Futures Liquidation Forms Local Price Bottom \u2014 A Return To $65,000 Inevitable?' The price of Bitcoin took a dip early this month, but there's some interesting analysis behind it.",
    "voice_id": "woman1"
  },
  {
    "text": "Oh, I saw that, Beth. Bitcoin dropped to around $60,000 but bounced back to about $62,000 shortly after. It was initially due to geopolitical tensions, but analysts suggest it could signal a shift in market sentiment. Over 4,000 long positions were liquidated earlier this month, which could lead to potential price recoveries. What do you make of that, Charlie?",
    "voice_id": "man2"
  },
  {
    "text": "Well, it does open up some interesting discussions about market cycles and the impact of external factors on crypto prices. Plus, it serves as a reminder of how quickly market sentiment can shift. But I think we should also consider how traders navigate these liquidations.",
    "voice_id": "man1"
  },
  {
    "text": "That's a valid point, Charlie. But let's not forget, these are all just possibilities. Nothing's for sure in the crypto world. Dana, I think you have some news for us too?",
    "voice_id": "woman1"
  },
  {
    "text": "Indeed, Beth. The next story is about SUI, which recently experienced a 95% surge due to the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut. However, it's currently testing a crucial supply zone, and there's speculation that it could fall to the $1.40 mark. Alex, you've got more details on this, right?",
    "voice_id": "woman2"
  },
  {
    "text": "Yes, Dana. Coinglass's on-chain data suggests a decline in market demand. More traders seem to be betting on a price drop. We could see a deeper correction if SUI fails to hold the $1.60 support level. So, the question is, are we looking at a buying opportunity around $1.40, or is this just the start of a deeper downturn for SUI?",
    "voice_id": "man1"
  },
  {
    "text": "Well, only time will tell, Alex. But it's definitely something we'll be keeping an eye on.",
    "voice_id": "woman2"
  },
  {
    "text": "Definitely. It's going to be an interesting week in the crypto world, that's for sure.",
    "voice_id": "man2"
  },
  {
    "text": "Absolutely. There's never a dull moment when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Thanks for the insightful discussion, everyone!",
