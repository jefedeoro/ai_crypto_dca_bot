Farside Investors are the source of this data, a company that specializes in the analysis of ETF flows.\n\nA Brief Obstacle\n\nThe $79 million outflow represents a significant shift in sentiment among investors who had previously demonstrated a strong interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Over the span of two days last week, the market attracted around $1 billion in inflows, implying a robust demand for these financial products.\n\nBitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win! Could you be next big winner? Play Now!\n\nThe main cause of this negative change was Ark and 21Shared\u2019s ARKB, which resulted in a substantial $134.7 million outflow.\n\nSource: Farside Investors\n\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT, the best-performing bitcoin ETF by net assets, drew $43 million. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC and VanEck\u2019s HODL, which received $8.8 million and $3.8 million, respectively, also helped. There were no new flows on the remaining eight funds, including Graysc\u0430le\u2019s GBTC, during the day.\n\nNevertheless, Bitcoin ETFs could bring in more than $21 billion to date. This number clearly signifies the rising use of Bitcoin as a new asset class and it is only going to see more hedge funds take larger positions.\n\nUS-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs have also seen significant interest from institutional investors, with 20% of the market owned by them as of October 22.\n\nInstitutional ownership of U.S. #Bitcoin Spot ETFs is around 20%, with asset managers holding 193K BTC (per Form 13F filings). pic.twitter.com/9YTOEH3G5w\n\n\u2014 Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) October 22, 2024\n\nInstitutional Demand Is Still Strong\n\nRegardless, while the latest ETF flow swings have been significant in themselves, they can not distract from what is an ongoing push towards institutional Bitcoin adoption. Among the main companies who have made large investments in these funds are Goldman Sachs and Millennium Management.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of options trading on 11 Bitcoin ETFs will help investors manage their Bitcoin exposure, boosting interest.\n\nThrough more efficient position hedging made possible by options trading, investors can help to steady the market and lower volatility over time. Analysts argue that this would draw more institutional money to the industry, therefore supporting Bitcoin\u2019s reputation as a credible investment tool.\n\nBTCUSD trading at $67,156 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\nBitcoin ETF: Looking Ahead\n\nAlthough outflows may cause concern, many analysts are positive about Bitcoin ETFs. Options trading\u2019s SEC approval is a turning point that could improve market efficiency and liquidity.\n\nMore institutional players coming into the space are likely to change the dynamics. The current pause in inflows could be a temporary phenomenon only; investors are repositioning their strategies given the shift in market conditions.\n\nRelated Reading\nShiba Inu Soars: Analyst Predicts 71% Rally In \u2018Meme Super Cycle\u2019 \u2013 Details\n1 week ago\n\nThe outlook for spot Bitcoin ETFs, looking into the long term, appears quite positive with the current uptick in adoption from the institutional space and trading of Bitcoin at or near three-month highs.\n\nThe recent outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs may indicate a temporary setback; however, the prevailing trend of heightened institutional interest and regulatory support indicates that this asset class is here to stay. Investors will be intently monitoring the rapid evolution of this market for any new developments.\n\nFeatured image from The Rio Times, chart from TradingView",

Based on Messari\u2019s tracking for Q3 2024, TRX\u2019s market capitalization increased by 24%, from nearly $11 billion to $13.5 billion. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter in which the token has increased its circulating market cap, pushing the company into the Top 10 biggest cryptos by market cap.\n\nRelated Reading\n100% Uptick For Shiba Inu? Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst\n1 week ago\n\nTRX\u2019s price surge also extended to TRX/BTC pairing, which also notched a 25% increase. The token sits below XRP and Dogecoin in the list of top cryptos by market cap. It is powered primarily by USDT transactions and is launching on SunPump, the first \u2018meme fair and online platform\u2019.\n\nTRON Gets A Boost From SunPump\n\nThe TRON network saw a massive increase in transaction volume in the third quarter thanks to the launching of SunPump. According to reports, TRX transactions increased 29% this third quarter to $151 million. In August alone, over 270 million TRX valued at $42 million was burned on SunPump. It\u2019s considered the largest single-day burn for TRON. As a deflationary token, TRX is burned every time it\u2019s used in a transaction to prop up its value.\n\nBitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win! Could you be next big winner? Play Now!\n\nTRON Supply Dips In Q3\n\nTRON sets a fixed supply of 100 billion coins to protect its value and prevent inflation. TRX\u2019s market supply dipped from 87.20 billion in the third quarter to 86.62 billion. The network\u2019s burning schedule, which outpaces the minting of new tokens, supports this. In short, TRX\u2019s annualized inflation rate hit -2.7% compared to -2.4% from the previous quarter.\n\nTRX market cap currently at $13.6 billion. Chart: TradingView\n\nTRON strives to find a balance between burning and printing new tokens. The network aims to decrease the token\u2019s circulating supply, which can benefit holders and investors. Also, the yield in staking TRX has increased 13% quarter-on-quarter, which attracts more users and investors.\n\nRelated Reading\nAnalysts On Bitcoin: 2024 US Election Could Steer The Crypto\u2019s Future\n1 week ago\nBig Things Ahead For TRON\n\nTRON is now one of the biggest cryptos by market cap, now valued at $13.5 billion. Holders and users can expect sustained growth for the network, thanks to increasing revenue, partly driven by the launching of a new meme coin fair and platform. Also, the network\u2019s token-burning policy currently outpaces minting, thus boosting the potential value of the token.\n\nFinally, stats from Dune suggest that over 90,000 meme coins have been launched through TRON\u2019s network using SunPump. August 20th was the most active day, with over 7,500 coins released, highlighting the meme coins\u2019 platform role in sustaining TRON.\n\nFeatured image from IQ.wiki, chart from TradingView",

Could you be next big winner? Play Now!\n\nCrypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted BTC\u2019s recovery just below the $66,000 mark, stressing that if this level can be maintained in the coming days, further gains could be in store.\n\nHistorical Patterns Suggest Bitcoin Could Surge Past $70,000\n\nIn a series of posts on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Martinez pointed out that Bitcoin is once again attempting to break through the critical 200-day moving average (MA), which currently sits between $63,000 and $64,000 on the daily chart.\u00a0\n\nThe analyst noted that after four previous rejections at this level this year, Bitcoin\u2019s repeated attempts to break above this level could signal a significant turning point for the upcoming price action.\n\nRelated Reading\nCrypto Analyst Predicts \u2018Giga Pump\u2019 For XRP Price, Here\u2019s The Target\n2 weeks ago\n\nMartinez also highlighted a historical pattern: each of the last three times Bitcoin successfully broke above the 200-day moving average, it led to parabolic bull runs.\u00a0\n\nThis suggests that if Bitcoin can consolidate above this key level for the remainder of the month, the likelihood of exceeding the $70,000 mark for the first time in nearly three months increases significantly. Looking ahead, the analyst has set a target of $78,000 for Bitcoin in the near term.\u00a0\n\nHistorical Trends And Election Dynamics Fuel Optimism\n\nBloomberg recently highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s price recovery, linking it to improving expectations around the US regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, particularly in the wake of the upcoming presidential election.\u00a0\n\nDemocratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris announced her commitment to establishing a supportive regulatory framework for crypto, coinciding with outreach efforts aimed at Black male voters as election day approaches.\u00a0\n\nIn contrast, Harris\u2019 Republican rival Donald Trump has positioned himself as a strong advocate for the digital asset industry, including promises to make changes to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and to establish a Bitcoin reserve for the nation, which Bloomberg believes could resonate with voters in a close race.\n\nNoelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, noted that recent market movements appear to be election-driven. Initially, Bitcoin\u2019s uptick was influenced by Trump\u2019s lead in prediction markets and polls.\u00a0\n\nThis was followed by favorable comments regarding crypto from the Harris campaign, suggesting a less restrictive approach compared to the current Biden administration. Although specifics of Harris\u2019s crypto policy remain unclear, the sentiment indicates a potential shift toward a more positive regulatory environment.\n\nRelated Reading\nWhy Isn\u2019t XRP Price Moving?

        "article": "Recently, both Near Protocol and Tron have shown differing performances, drawing attention. Near Protocol\u2019s trading environment remains lively despite recent declines, suggesting a possible rebound to its all-time high. Concurrently, the Tron (TRX) price has exhibited remarkable stability, symbolizing a steady ascent amid a fluctuating market.\n\nUnlike others, BlockDAG is experiencing a standout phase. It swiftly amassed $4 million in a single day, totaling a staggering over $90 million so far. This overwhelming interest has placed BlockDAG among the most successful presale ever, hinting at a potential surge in the value of BDAG coins in future batches.\n\nExploring Near Protocol\u2019s Market Movements\n\nNear Protocol has sparked discussions lately, especially after notable price shifts in September. Initially dropping 10% to $4.92, it has since experienced a 65% boost in daily trading volume, maintaining optimism about its future.\n\nMarket analysts speculate that Near Protocol could revisit its previous highs, potentially reaching its all-time high again. While a short-term surge to $52 seems ambitious, the token has achieved significant peaks before. Although these are merely projections, the sustained interest in Near Protocol highlights its ongoing relevance.\n\nTron (TRX) Price Stability Amid Growth\n\nIn early October, the TRON Network declared a record $577 million in third-quarter revenue for 2024, marking a 43% increase from the last period. Yet, the Tron (TRX) price has stayed stable, averaging around $0.15.\n\nThis period of solid financial results paired with price stability suggests a consolidation phase. The minimal growth rate of 0.46% over the month, alongside neutral market sentiments reflected in RSI and ADX, indicates little immediate price movement for Tron (TRX).\n\nBlockDAG Soars to Nearly $90M, Gaining $10M in Just 72 Hours\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s presale trajectory has been meteoric, a phenomenon rarely seen in the cryptocurrency sphere. It managed to amass an impressive $10 million within 72 hours, skyrocketing its cumulative total to over $90 million. This exceptional rise has sparked conversations among crypto enthusiasts and analysts alike, wondering if BlockDAG might echo the storied post-launch ascendancy of Bitcoin.\n\nThis remarkable surge transcends mere presale figures. Since the onset of 2024, strategic partnerships and a well-received testnet launch have significantly raised BlockDAG\u2019s profile, attracting assets from prominent Bitcoin holders. This influx of heavyweight backers has not only elevated market confidence but also broadened the appeal of BDAG coins, fueling an increase in demand.\n\nPrice evolution from the initial to the twenty-third batch reflects this burgeoning interest, with the coin\u2019s value climbing to $0.0206, delivering a staggering 1960% return to early backers. This continuing price appreciation is capturing the attention of the global crypto community, signaling a vibrant market trend.\n\nFor those considering a foray into the crypto market, now presents a prime opportunity. With 13.8 billion coins already distributed, there remains a potential for significant gains. Engaging now offers a chance to ride this financial wave, capitalizing on BDAG coins\u2019 current low prices, which are projected to rise with ongoing market momentum.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWrapping up the top cryptocurrency options, here\u2019s a quick comparison of three noteworthy coins. Near Protocol shows potential for significant returns despite recent price fluctuations, suggesting it might reach its all-time high again. Tron (TRX) is notable for its stability, with steady, minor growth.\n\nIn contrast, BlockDAG truly leads, having raised over $90 million. This considerable demand indicates that its value could see substantial increases in future presale batches, making it a compelling option for those looking to participate.\n\nDiscover More About BlockDAG:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\nDisclaimer:\u00a0This is a paid release.
