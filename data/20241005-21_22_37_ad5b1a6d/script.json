This surge comes after a rocky couple of months, where BTC faced two separate 20% downturns in August and September. But now that October is here, a month historically known for bullish trends, analysts are buzzing with optimism. Bitcoin recorded a 3% increase within just 24 hours, reaching $65,500, and many are speculating that this could be the start of a significant bull run.\n\nCrypto investor Scott Melker has pointed out that if Bitcoin closes above $65,000, it would mark the first higher high since its peak of $74,000 back in March. This could signal a major trend shift from the lows we saw in August. Analysts like Lark Davis highlight that October has averaged a return of about 22.90%, which could potentially push Bitcoin to around $79,000. Plus, Rekt Capital notes that historically, Bitcoin tends to break out around 154 to 163 days post-Halving, and we\u2019re currently at 159 days since the last Halving in April\u2014this timing feels promising.\n\nAll in all, with the recent dovish stance from the US Federal Reserve and a resurgence of inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, there seems to be a perfect storm brewing for Bitcoin's recovery. With massive gains anticipated for the latter half of this year, it\u2019s definitely a thrilling time for crypto enthusiasts! What do you all think\u2014are we gearing up for a new all-time high?"
