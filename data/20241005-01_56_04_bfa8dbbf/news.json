AsAsh Crypto pointed out, the price of Bitcoin dropped by 7.5% in the first week of October 2023. According to the BTC/USD price chart, this decline saw the price of Bitcoin fall below $26,500. However, it soon rebounded from this point. By the end of October 2023, Bitcoin had rallied to close the month at over $35,000, representing a remarkable 33% increase from the month\u2019s low.Fast forward to October 2024, and it appears that Bitcoin is once again repeating its pattern from the previous year. At the start of the month, Bitcoin was trading just below $64,000, a strong position given its recent bullish trends.

Halvings are periodic events about every four years that permanently cut the BTC block subsidy in half.In the chart, the analyst has also attached the data for the coin issuance on the network (colored in blue). From this metric, the effect of the Halving is apparent, as miners can suddenly only mint about half as many coins after each of these events as before them.Related ReadingShiba Inu Leads Whale Frenzy: Large SHIB Transfers See Massive 360% Spike3 days agoMiners make theirincomethrough two main sources, the transaction fees and the block subsidy, but most of the contribution generally comes from the latter. Thus, the miners depend on the block subsidy to make their income.After the latest Halving, the miners naturally came under immense pressure because their revenue took a drastic hit. The exchange inflow trend would suggest that these chain validators had decided to sell off their reserves in response to this income squeeze.The high inflows from the Bitcoin miners had continued for a while, but the 30-day MA of their exchange inflow has recently reversed, a potential sign that this cohort is finally pulling back on their selling. If this starts a sustained trend, then the cryptocurrency\u2019s price might benefit from it.BTC PriceBitcoin has retraced much of its recent recovery during the last few days, as its price is now down to $60,300.The price of the coin seems to have plunged recently | Source:BTCUSDT on TradingViewFeatured image from Dall-E, CryptoQuant.com, chart from TradingView.com"

Following a two-month high of $66,500 last Friday, the cryptocurrency retraced approximately 6% in the past week to around $60,000 by Thursday.Key Buy Zones For BitcoinThe anticipated bullish trend for Bitcoin was initially fueled by easing economic conditions, particularly following the US Federal Reserve\u2019sdecisionto cut interest rates on September 18.However, escalatinggeopolitical tensionsin the Middle East have shifted investor sentiment, prompting many to seek refuge in traditional safe-haven assets like gold.BitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win! Could you be next big winner?Play Now!Additionally, concerns regarding the macroeconomic landscape have intensified, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested the possibility of further rate cuts of 0.50% in the months ahead.This confluence of factors has led to a broadermarket sell-off, with Bitcoin, Ethereum and the top cryptocurrencies on the market experiencing substantial liquidity outflows estimated at nearly $300 million, as reflected in the total crypto market capitalization.The 1D chart shows the total crypto market cap value drop in the past seven days. Source:TOTAL on TradingView.comDespite the recent decline, crypto analyst VirtualBacon provided a moreoptimistic outlookon social media, noting that Bitcoin has returned to the \u201cBull Market Support Band.\u201dThe analyst highlights that this support band has historically provided a cushion during corrections between the current market prices and the $62,500 mark on the weekly timeframe.VirtualBacon emphasized that a weekly close above $58,000 could indicate a healthy correction, setting the stage for a resurgence. Conversely, a break below this threshold would necessitate reevaluating bullish strategies.The analyst pointed to two keybuy zones: $62,500 and a lower range between $58,800 and $60,000. These zones coincide with previous highs and align with the 200-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a significant long-term support level for any bull market.The 200-Day EMA, currently around the $60,000 mark, has been pivotal over the past six months. It has acted as support and resistance during various phases of Bitcoin\u2019s price movements in March, May and July of this year.September Jobs Report Looms LargeIn his analysis, VirtualBacon explained that if Bitcoin bounces back from $60,000, it would signal strength in the market. However, a daily close below $58,000 \u2013 or a weekly close below that level \u2013 could signal a potential bearish trend reversal.VirtualBacon outlined a strategy for capitalizing on the current dip, indicating a willingness to accumulateBTCin the $58,000 to $60,000 range, which he views as a high-risk, high-reward zone. Nonetheless, he cautioned that a close below $57,000 would be a significant red flag.Related ReadingDogecoin On-Chain Spike Triggers 180% Price Rally Prediction\u2014What\u2019s Next?1 day agoFor the analyst, as long as Bitcoin holds above $58,000, there is potential for a higher low, setting the stage for a new price peak above $66,000. However, macroeconomic factors will remain crucial in shapingmarket sentiment.This week\u2019s release of the Septemberjobs reportwill be particularly significant, as it will provide insights into the current unemployment rate, which could influence future Bitcoin price movements, according to the analyst:4.2%: Very bullish for the market.4.3%: Neutral outlook.4.4%: Caution advised.4.5% and above: Bearish implications.At the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Jerome Powell identified 4.4% as a critical threshold.

Solo staking allows crypto investors to earn passive income while directly contributing to the security of the Ethereum network.BitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win! Could you be next big winner?Play Now!Buterin views this high entry threshold as a barrier that prevents smaller ETH holders from participating. He suggested temporarily increasing bandwidth requirements to reduce the minimum staking deposit to 16 or 24 ETH. Buterin elaborated:It\u2019s net-good for both staking accessibility and scale. Then once we figure out peerdas, bandwidth reqs go back down, and once we figure out orbit SSF, the deposit minimum can drop to 1 ETH.It\u2019s important to note that ETH holders can still stake with as little as 1 ETH by using third-party staking services, centralized platforms, or staking pools. However, these options don\u2019t offer the same level of control over one\u2019s ETH as solo staking, where the node operator retains full custody of their holdings.During the Ethereum Singapore 2024 event in September, Buterin emphasized the significance of solo stakers in bolstering Ethereum\u2019s security and decentralization to tackle potential 51% attacks.At the event, Buterin said that even a small increase in the proportion of solo stakers on the Ethereum network could work as an \u201cextra layer of defense\u201d for both security and privacy.Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions Continue To ThriveWhile the 32 ETH barrier may discourage small-scale ETH enthusiasts from solo staking, they can still benefit from the growing popularity of Ethereum layer-2 solutions, which have made transactions more affordable.For instance, in June 2024, layer-2 scaling platform Optimismannouncedthe launch of open-source and permissionless fault proofs, enabling users to verify off-chain transactions\u2019 validity securely.Similarly, in August 2024, asset manager Franklin Templeton approved another layer-2 solution when itlaunchedits OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) on the Arbitrum network.Related ReadingEthereum Layer 2 Networks Just Set A New Record8 months agoSimilarly, crypto exchange Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum layer-2 rollup Base haswitnessedrapid adoption as its total value locked (TVL) currently stands at slightly over $2.12 billion, according todatafrom DeFiLlama.As layer-2 solutions continue to succeed, their positive impact may extend to the Ethereum network.
