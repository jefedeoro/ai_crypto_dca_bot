The flagship cryptocurrency has spent most of the last two quarters in consolidation, fluctuating within the $50,000 and $70,000 range.This uninspiring performance has sparked conversations about the current cycle, with several analysts and experts predicting whether thebull run is still on. Amongst the latest to comment is the CryptoQuant CEO, who offered an interesting on-chain insight into the cycle.Why Are Whales Taking Less Profit This Cycle?In a post on the X platform, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Jurevealedthat the Bitcoin whales have held onto their assets this cycle. As a result, the large investors have set the record for the least profit-taking compared to other cycles if the current bull run ends now.BitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win!

It basically evaluates the profitability of different cohorts of Bitcoin holders.Source:Ki_young_ju/XTypically, when the Realized Profit Ratio of whales is high, it implies that asell-offis likely ongoing, with the large investors believing that prices have peaked. On the other hand, a low Realized Profit Ratio often indicates a low level of profit-taking, meaning that investors are not cutting their losses or expecting further price gains.The current on-chain data points to a trend where the large holders have taken the least amount of profits across any bull cycle. This could mean that the Bitcoin whales still have faith inBitcoin\u2019s long-term potential. Ultimately, this suggests that the current bull run is far from the end, and there is the possibility of the Bitcoin price uptrend resuming.Bitcoin \u2018Dolphin\u2019 Addresses On The Rise Again: SantimentIn a post on X, Santimentrevealedthat the Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cDolphin\u201d cohort, holding between 0.1 to 10 BTC, have been growing steadily over the past few months.

Could you be next big winner?Play Now!Source:Binance ResearchInterestingly, the term \u201cultrasound money\u201d draws inspiration from Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) \u201csound money\u201d narrative. While BTC\u2019s supply is capped at 21 million, ETH\u2019s supply can become deflationary, theoretically increasing scarcity and protecting it from inflation-driven erosion of purchasing power.Ethereum\u2019s high issuance rate could be attributed to several factors, including low mainnet on-chain activity, leading to a low transaction fee and, consequently, lower ETH burn rates.In 2021, Ethereum core developers implemented EIP-1559, which introduced a fee-burning mechanism that aimed to reduce ETH\u2019s circulating supply, thereby creating deflationary pressure on the token.However, with declining mainnet activity, the amount of ETH being burned is lagging behind the ETH issuance rate, leading to a net inflationary trend.Notably, September 2024 experienced one of the lowest ETH burn rates since the highly anticipatedMergeevent, when Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions To Blame For Low ETH Burn Rate?The report points to March 2024 as the starting point of Ethereum\u2019s inflationary trend, following the implementation of EIP-4844 or theDencunupgrade, which reduced transaction costs on layer-2 scaling platforms such as Optimism (OP), Arbitrum (ARB), Base, and Polygon (MATIC). The report adds:As L2s cannibalized network activity throughout the year \u2013 further impacted by broader market conditions \u2013 transaction fees and, consequently, burned fees on Ethereum declined, with September recording one of the lowest levels since the Merge. This has prevented ETH from decreasing in supply to remain deflationary, leading to the net positive daily supply changes we now see.Recent trends corroborate the assertion above, as network activity on layer-2 solutions grows across different metrics. For instance, areportin July 2024 noted that daily active addresses and transaction volume on Polygon had soared significantly.Related ReadingEthereum Solo Staking Made Easier?
