This huge number is higher than both Tron (2 million daily active addresses) and Solana (2.4 million daily active addresses) during the same time period.\n\nRelated Reading\n$6 Million ETH Sale: Ethereum Foundation Joins Whale Liquidation Frenzy\n2 weeks ago\n\nThe growth of NEAR is in line with a larger trend in the AI cryptocurrency market. This shows that blockchain and AI are becoming more and more intertwined. This point of contact is driving more and more technological progress and user engagement across these channels.\n\nSource: CryptoRank\nSurge In The AI-Cryptocurrency Sector\n\nOne of the most important factors influencing user engagement on NEAR is the rapid growth in AI-related decentralized applications or dApps. As DappRadar reported, AI dApps increased by 70% compared with the previous quarter in Q3.\n\nBitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win! Could you be next big winner? Play Now!\n\nThe survey indicated that AI dApps garnered 4.3 million daily unique active wallets, illustrating the growing interest in this sector of the cryptocurrency industry. NEAR Protocol has swiftly leveraged this trend by establishing collaborations with major corporations such as Nvidia and Alibaba to augment its AI capabilities.\n\nNEAR market cap currently at $5.5 billion. Chart: TradingView\n\nWith this further integration with AI, in addition to NEAR\u2019s strong growing ecosystem, the network finds itself at the helm of innovation in this emerging blockchain landscape. Although the ecosystem is still experiencing positive growth, market sentiment remains cautious as the price of the protocol decreased by 2.36% to $4.87, along with a more than 30% decrease in trading volume.\n\nNEAR Protocol: Price Fluctuations Amid Market Ambiguity\n\nThe current price difficulties of NEAR can be ascribed to overarching market conditions rather than the protocol\u2019s intrinsic value. Despite the optimistic outlook suggested by daily active addresses and collaborations, recent data indicates a 0.4% reduction in NEAR\u2019s circulating supply, now totaling 1.11 billion tokens. The protocol\u2019s market capitalization now stands at $5.42 billion, ranking it 23rd overall in the market.\n\nNEAR price projected to rise.

Technical analysis forecasts an upward trend in the forthcoming seven days, with the token presently trading 220% beneath its projected value for the subsequent month. During a three-month interval, the price is anticipated to rise by 240%, indicative of favorable market sentiment and heightened adoption.\n\nProlonged projections are similarly positive, with a six-month growth anticipated at 178% and a one-year projection indicating a 165% increase. Although short-term price fluctuations may indicate general market instability, the long-term prospects for NEAR are clear. Investors must keep tabs of forthcoming ecosystem advancements and AI trends to assess the protocol\u2019s price trajectory.\n\nFeatured image from Pexels, chart from Avark",

        "article": "Aptos and Near Protocol have each made strong cases as investment opportunities this year. Both have, after all, made significant strides in 2024. However, their large market cap limits their potential upside to a maximum of 2x to 10x under the most bullish conditions. Investors looking for real gains will find it in opportunities that haven\u2019t scratched the surface of their moon potential just yet. Well, that opportunity has arrived with the launch of revenue-sharing DeFi protocol Zig Network (ZIG). Learn why analysts believe Zig Network will outperform both Aptos and Near Protocol in 2024 and beyond.\n\nAptos catches fire\n\nAptos is on a hot streak as October draws to an end. The Layer-1 blockchain protocol has turned in a 69% gain in the past month, no doubt delighting Aptos holders who held through the year\u2019s lows. This indicates a strong bullish sentiment among traders. However, investors looking to get in on the gains will have already been late. Although there is yet some upside for Aptos, its potential is handicapped by its $5 billion market cap.\n\nNear Protocol settles at a comfy range\n\nNear Protocol had been fluctuating wildly between $3 and $6 in previous months. However, as the year draws to an end, Near Protocol prices have settled in at a comfy $5. As of press time, Near Protocol has recorded an 18.8% gain in the past month, despite struggling to hold on to the momentum it had gained earlier this year. But much like Aptos, Near Protocol has already pumped hard and sits at a $5.9 billion market cap, limiting its potential to pump hard.\n\nZig Network tipped for big-time gains in 2024 and beyond\n\nThe smart money knows that the real profits to be made are in low-cap gems with the backing, the fundamentals, and the value proposition to go on a meteoric run instead of tokens that have already mooned. This is why analysts believe revenue-sharing DeFi newcomer Zig Network is better positioned to turn in biblical gains in 2024 and beyond than Aptos or Near Protocol.\n\nZig Network, for one, has timed its launch perfectly just as DeFi begins winding up for a massive resurgence and Zig Network is expected to be one of the key players in the future of the emerging DeFi ecosystem. Simplifying the DeFi experience by enabling users to stake, farm yield, and generate passive income through its simple interface, Zig Network could serve as the bulwark from whence millions and millions of new Web3 users can be onboarded.\n\nThat means its $ZIG token could be the beneficiary of a major pump one that could go upwards of 100x. With tokens at just $0.01 during stage 1 of the launch, now is the best time to join the Zig Network presale.\n\nTo find out more about the Zig Network presale use the links below:\nParticipate in the Zig Network Presale\nRead the Zignet Whitepaper\n\n\u00a0\n\nDisclaimer:\u00a0This is a paid release.

Farside Investors are the source of this data, a company that specializes in the analysis of ETF flows.\n\nA Brief Obstacle\n\nThe $79 million outflow represents a significant shift in sentiment among investors who had previously demonstrated a strong interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Over the span of two days last week, the market attracted around $1 billion in inflows, implying a robust demand for these financial products.\n\nBitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win! Could you be next big winner? Play Now!\n\nThe main cause of this negative change was Ark and 21Shared\u2019s ARKB, which resulted in a substantial $134.7 million outflow.\n\nSource: Farside Investors\n\nBlackRock\u2019s IBIT, the best-performing bitcoin ETF by net assets, drew $43 million. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC and VanEck\u2019s HODL, which received $8.8 million and $3.8 million, respectively, also helped. There were no new flows on the remaining eight funds, including Graysc\u0430le\u2019s GBTC, during the day.\n\nNevertheless, Bitcoin ETFs could bring in more than $21 billion to date. This number clearly signifies the rising use of Bitcoin as a new asset class and it is only going to see more hedge funds take larger positions.\n\nUS-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs have also seen significant interest from institutional investors, with 20% of the market owned by them as of October 22.\n\nInstitutional ownership of U.S. #Bitcoin Spot ETFs is around 20%, with asset managers holding 193K BTC (per Form 13F filings). pic.twitter.com/9YTOEH3G5w\n\n\u2014 Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) October 22, 2024\n\nInstitutional Demand Is Still Strong\n\nRegardless, while the latest ETF flow swings have been significant in themselves, they can not distract from what is an ongoing push towards institutional Bitcoin adoption. Among the main companies who have made large investments in these funds are Goldman Sachs and Millennium Management.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of options trading on 11 Bitcoin ETFs will help investors manage their Bitcoin exposure, boosting interest.\n\nThrough more efficient position hedging made possible by options trading, investors can help to steady the market and lower volatility over time. Analysts argue that this would draw more institutional money to the industry, therefore supporting Bitcoin\u2019s reputation as a credible investment tool.\n\nBTCUSD trading at $67,156 on the daily chart: TradingView.com\nBitcoin ETF: Looking Ahead\n\nAlthough outflows may cause concern, many analysts are positive about Bitcoin ETFs. Options trading\u2019s SEC approval is a turning point that could improve market efficiency and liquidity.\n\nMore institutional players coming into the space are likely to change the dynamics. The current pause in inflows could be a temporary phenomenon only; investors are repositioning their strategies given the shift in market conditions.\n\nRelated Reading\nShiba Inu Soars: Analyst Predicts 71% Rally In \u2018Meme Super Cycle\u2019 \u2013 Details\n5 days ago\n\nThe outlook for spot Bitcoin ETFs, looking into the long term, appears quite positive with the current uptick in adoption from the institutional space and trading of Bitcoin at or near three-month highs.\n\nThe recent outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs may indicate a temporary setback; however, the prevailing trend of heightened institutional interest and regulatory support indicates that this asset class is here to stay. Investors will be intently monitoring the rapid evolution of this market for any new developments.\n\nFeatured image from The Rio Times, chart from TradingView",

This index makes use of the data of the following five factors in order to determine the sentiment: trading volume, volatility, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. Once found, it represents the market mentality as a score between 0 and 100.\n\nWhen the metric has a value greater than 53, it means the traders as a whole share a sentiment of greed right now. On the other hand, it being under the 47 mark implies the dominance of fear in the market.

This is a notable change from how the mood in the market was last week, as the index had declined into the fear zone then.\n\nThe below chart shows how the value of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has changed over the past year:\n\nThe value of the metric appears to have been rising in recent days | Source: Alternative\n\nFrom the graph, it\u2019s visible that this latest uplift in the sentiment, which has come as a result of the asset\u2019s rally to $68,000, has taken the index to the highest value since the end of July. Back then, the high sentiment values had led to a top for the cryptocurrency. This type of pattern is something that has actually been witnessed throughout history.\n\nIt turns out that Bitcoin has a tendency to move in the direction opposite to what the crowd is expecting and the probability of such a contrary move increases the more the traders lean towards one side.\n\nIn the extreme regions, this likelihood is the strongest, so tops and bottoms have often formed when the investors have shared these sentiments. The current value of the index is just outside the extreme greed zone, so a top could become likely for the asset should the investor mentality continue to improve.\n\nRelated Reading\nBitcoin Analyst Reveals Best On-Chain Metric For \u2018Day-To-Day Trading\u2019\n1 week ago\n\nThe sentiment may also not even have to improve further for such a scenario to follow out, as the top back in July had occurred when the index had a value of 74, only one unit greater than the current one.\n\nBTC Price\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $68,000, up more than 9% over the last week.\n\nThe price of the coin appears to have been rising recently | Source: BTCUSDT on TradingView\nFeatured image from Dall-E, Alternative.me, chart from TradingView.com",

Based on Messari\u2019s tracking for Q3 2024, TRX\u2019s market capitalization increased by 24%, from nearly $11 billion to $13.5 billion. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter in which the token has increased its circulating market cap, pushing the company into the Top 10 biggest cryptos by market cap.\n\nRelated Reading\n100% Uptick For Shiba Inu?

TRX\u2019s market supply dipped from 87.20 billion in the third quarter to 86.62 billion. The network\u2019s burning schedule, which outpaces the minting of new tokens, supports this. In short, TRX\u2019s annualized inflation rate hit -2.7% compared to -2.4% from the previous quarter.\n\nTRX market cap currently at $13.6 billion. Chart: TradingView\n\nTRON strives to find a balance between burning and printing new tokens.

Also, the network\u2019s token-burning policy currently outpaces minting, thus boosting the potential value of the token.\n\nFinally, stats from Dune suggest that over 90,000 meme coins have been launched through TRON\u2019s network using SunPump.

After reaching its latest ATH of $1.56 a week ago, the cryptocurrency has been on a 7-day downtrend.\n\nBitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win! Could you be next big winner?

Popcat bounced 16.6% from this zone on Thursday, propelling the token\u2019s surge toward the $1.3 resistance level.\n\nOn the last day, the cryptocurrency retested the trendline twice after surpassing the $1.4 mark. A successful reclaim of this zone could propel the price toward a new ATH.\n\nA market watcher considers that if Bitcoin\u2019s price holds, Popcat should successfully break this level by next week. It\u2019s worth noting that the cat-themed token followed BTC\u2019s lead on Friday morning, surging 2.4% as the flagship cryptocurrency neared the $69,000 mark.\n\nIs A Correction Looming?\n\nCrypto analyst Sanchez noted that the memecoin\u2019s price was \u201crunning flat\u201d in the four-chart on Friday morning.

Trader Crypto Tony suggested that the cryptocurrency could see a retest of the monthly opening of around $1.01 in case of a rejection.\n\nDespite the correction forecast, the memecoin has seen a 7% increase in the last 24 hours, trading 8.7% below its ATH. Popcat reclaimed the $1.3 mark and is attempting to confirm the breakout and regain the $1.4 resistance level.\n\nRelated Reading\nPolkadot (DOT) Gearing Up For \u2018Massive Breakout\u2019, Will It Skyrocket To $20?\n1 week ago\n\nAnalyst CryptoGodJohn stated that the cryptocurrency \u201clooks like it wants new ATHs and beyond this weekend\u201d following its recent performance.

The first major resistance is near the $2,550 level. A clear move above the $2,550 resistance might send the price toward the $2,580 resistance. An upside break above the $2,580 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,620 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,650 level or $2,720.\n\nAnother Pullback In ETH?\n\nIf Ethereum fails to clear the $2,520 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,480 level.

        "article": "Recently, both Near Protocol and Tron have shown differing performances, drawing attention. Near Protocol\u2019s trading environment remains lively despite recent declines, suggesting a possible rebound to its all-time high. Concurrently, the Tron (TRX) price has exhibited remarkable stability, symbolizing a steady ascent amid a fluctuating market.\n\nUnlike others, BlockDAG is experiencing a standout phase. It swiftly amassed $4 million in a single day, totaling a staggering over $90 million so far. This overwhelming interest has placed BlockDAG among the most successful presale ever, hinting at a potential surge in the value of BDAG coins in future batches.\n\nExploring Near Protocol\u2019s Market Movements\n\nNear Protocol has sparked discussions lately, especially after notable price shifts in September. Initially dropping 10% to $4.92, it has since experienced a 65% boost in daily trading volume, maintaining optimism about its future.\n\nMarket analysts speculate that Near Protocol could revisit its previous highs, potentially reaching its all-time high again. While a short-term surge to $52 seems ambitious, the token has achieved significant peaks before. Although these are merely projections, the sustained interest in Near Protocol highlights its ongoing relevance.\n\nTron (TRX) Price Stability Amid Growth\n\nIn early October, the TRON Network declared a record $577 million in third-quarter revenue for 2024, marking a 43% increase from the last period. Yet, the Tron (TRX) price has stayed stable, averaging around $0.15.\n\nThis period of solid financial results paired with price stability suggests a consolidation phase. The minimal growth rate of 0.46% over the month, alongside neutral market sentiments reflected in RSI and ADX, indicates little immediate price movement for Tron (TRX).\n\nBlockDAG Soars to Nearly $90M, Gaining $10M in Just 72 Hours\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s presale trajectory has been meteoric, a phenomenon rarely seen in the cryptocurrency sphere. It managed to amass an impressive $10 million within 72 hours, skyrocketing its cumulative total to over $90 million. This exceptional rise has sparked conversations among crypto enthusiasts and analysts alike, wondering if BlockDAG might echo the storied post-launch ascendancy of Bitcoin.\n\nThis remarkable surge transcends mere presale figures. Since the onset of 2024, strategic partnerships and a well-received testnet launch have significantly raised BlockDAG\u2019s profile, attracting assets from prominent Bitcoin holders. This influx of heavyweight backers has not only elevated market confidence but also broadened the appeal of BDAG coins, fueling an increase in demand.\n\nPrice evolution from the initial to the twenty-third batch reflects this burgeoning interest, with the coin\u2019s value climbing to $0.0206, delivering a staggering 1960% return to early backers. This continuing price appreciation is capturing the attention of the global crypto community, signaling a vibrant market trend.\n\nFor those considering a foray into the crypto market, now presents a prime opportunity. With 13.8 billion coins already distributed, there remains a potential for significant gains. Engaging now offers a chance to ride this financial wave, capitalizing on BDAG coins\u2019 current low prices, which are projected to rise with ongoing market momentum.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWrapping up the top cryptocurrency options, here\u2019s a quick comparison of three noteworthy coins. Near Protocol shows potential for significant returns despite recent price fluctuations, suggesting it might reach its all-time high again. Tron (TRX) is notable for its stability, with steady, minor growth.\n\nIn contrast, BlockDAG truly leads, having raised over $90 million. This considerable demand indicates that its value could see substantial increases in future presale batches, making it a compelling option for those looking to participate.\n\nDiscover More About BlockDAG:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\nDisclaimer:\u00a0This is a paid release.

Short-term holders (STH) are traders who engage in brief buying and selling activities, often employing strategies like day trading or swing trading to capitalize on Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations.\n\nBitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win! Could you be next big winner? Play Now!\n\nOn the other hand, long-term holders (LTH) adopt a buy-and-hold strategy, aiming for long-term gains by holding onto their Bitcoin for extended periods. This distinction sets the stage for understanding the recent changes in market activity.\n\nIn his analysis, Taha noted a sharp decline in the realized capitalization for long-term holders, which dropped from $19 billion to -$5 billion. This indicates that long-term holders have been taking profits or closing their positions, potentially signalling reduced confidence in further price gains.\n\nBitcoin holders metric. | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nOn the flip side, short-term holders have increased their buying activity, with their realized capitalization rising from -$17 billion to $11 billion. This suggests that short-term traders either take on more risk or bet on potential price increases, creating a more volatile market environment.\n\nAdditionally, Taha touched on the Korea Premium Index, often called the \u201cKimchi Premium.\u201d This index tracks the price difference between Bitcoin traded on South Korean and global exchanges.\n\nCurrently, the index is near zero or negative, meaning Bitcoin is trading at a lower price in South Korea than the rest of the world.\n\nBitcoin Korea premium index. | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nThis implies reduced buying pressure from Korean traders, who have historically played a large role in increasing cryptocurrency prices due to the local trading culture. A negative premium suggests low demand from South Korean investors, potentially adding to the market\u2019s uncertainty.\n\nNet Realized Profit And Loss Trends\n\nAnother key metric Taha focused on is Bitcoin\u2019s net realized profit and loss (NRPL), which tracks market participants\u2019 total net profit or loss.\n\nPositive NRPL values indicate that more investors are taking profits, while negative values suggest more losses are being realized. Currently, the NRPL is approaching a critical $4 billion mark.\n\nRelated Reading\nBitcoin Price Forecast: This Week\u2019s Trends And Historical Patterns For Q4\n2 weeks ago\n\nTaha highlighted that crossing the $4 billion threshold in past market cycles has often coincided with significant market peaks or troughs.\n\nBitcoin net realized profit and loss (NRPL). | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nThe red line marking the $4 billion level across the chart (above) represents a key point of market activity. According to the analyst, when NRPL crosses this line, it can indicate a surge in trading activity as more investors either lock in their profits or cut their losses.\n\nTaha further pointed out that these points have historically been pivotal moments in Bitcoin\u2019s price action, and the current proximity to this level suggests that another significant market movement could be on the horizon.\n\nBTC price is moving downwards on the 1-hour chart.
