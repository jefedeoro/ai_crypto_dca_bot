Admittedly, meme coins have been dominating headlines, especially on Solana. From MooDeng to Bonk and Pepe, traders are on the lookout.Meme Coin Trader Misses A $25 Million PayoutIn the past week, eyes have been on Sui Network, a modern blockchain that claims to process over 50,000 transactions every second (TPS) and is faster than Solana. The spike in activity results from the success of what\u2019s arguably one of the largest meme coins in its ecosystem.Related ReadingAptos (APT) Jumps 11% Following Acquisition Of Japanese Blockchain Developer HashPallette1 day agoAfter launching nearly six days ago, Sudeng (HIPPO) is on fire, posting impressive higher highs.

According to trackers, one meme coin trader isregrettingafter exiting early, dumping HIPPO for a small profit.Meme coin trader sells 1.8 billion HIPPO | Source: SuiScanOn launch, the trader sold 258 SUI, worth around $433, for 1.8 billion HIPPO. This is nearly 20% of the total supply standing at 10 billion. However, the trader chose to sell all this stash for 6,299 SUI days later, racking in nearly $11,000.The problem is, if the trader had chosen to wait, even for another 36 hours, it would have turned out to be major gains. As of October 4, the 1.8 billion HIPPO, is now worth over $25 million.HIPPO prices moving upward on the 1-hour chart | Source:HIPPOUSDT on MEXC, TradingViewThe premature decision to sell is proving costly and is a missed opportunity. All the same, the trader shouldn\u2019t be blamed. The $11,000 earned represents a more than 200X gain.Moreover, even if the trader would have held on, becoming a diamond hand and waiting for prices to rally, it would have been tough for the trader to exit all at once.HIPPO Concentration A Concern: Will The Sudeng Pump?HIPPO is not very liquid, and looking at ownership fromSuiScan, one address controls over 7.6 billion tokens, which is more than 76% of the total supply.If the trader held on, the address would be the second largest. Any attempt to sell would force prices lower, triggering panic as other holders scramble to the exits.Related ReadingXRP Crashes 14% As Whales Send Deposits To Exchanges1 day agoCurrently, traders will be closely monitoring how HIPPO performs. As a meme coin, much depends on hype and whether there is a fear of missing out (FOMO).
