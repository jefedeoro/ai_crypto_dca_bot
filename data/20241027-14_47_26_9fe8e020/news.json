        "article": "Este art\u00edculo tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 disponible en espa\u00f1ol.\n\nAs of Q3 2024, CryptoRank stated that 3 million addresses were active every day on NEAR Protocol, making it a major player in the blockchain world. This huge number is higher than both Tron (2 million daily active addresses) and Solana (2.4 million daily active addresses) during the same time period.\n\nRelated Reading\n$6 Million ETH Sale: Ethereum Foundation Joins Whale Liquidation Frenzy\n2 weeks ago\n\nThe growth of NEAR is in line with a larger trend in the AI cryptocurrency market. This shows that blockchain and AI are becoming more and more intertwined. This point of contact is driving more and more technological progress and user engagement across these channels.\n\nSource: CryptoRank\nSurge In The AI-Cryptocurrency Sector\n\nOne of the most important factors influencing user engagement on NEAR is the rapid growth in AI-related decentralized applications or dApps. As DappRadar reported, AI dApps increased by 70% compared with the previous quarter in Q3.\n\nBitStarz Player Lands $2,459,124 Record Win! Could you be next big winner? Play Now!\n\nThe survey indicated that AI dApps garnered 4.3 million daily unique active wallets, illustrating the growing interest in this sector of the cryptocurrency industry. NEAR Protocol has swiftly leveraged this trend by establishing collaborations with major corporations such as Nvidia and Alibaba to augment its AI capabilities.\n\nNEAR market cap currently at $5.5 billion. Chart: TradingView\n\nWith this further integration with AI, in addition to NEAR\u2019s strong growing ecosystem, the network finds itself at the helm of innovation in this emerging blockchain landscape. Although the ecosystem is still experiencing positive growth, market sentiment remains cautious as the price of the protocol decreased by 2.36% to $4.87, along with a more than 30% decrease in trading volume.\n\nNEAR Protocol: Price Fluctuations Amid Market Ambiguity\n\nThe current price difficulties of NEAR can be ascribed to overarching market conditions rather than the protocol\u2019s intrinsic value. Despite the optimistic outlook suggested by daily active addresses and collaborations, recent data indicates a 0.4% reduction in NEAR\u2019s circulating supply, now totaling 1.11 billion tokens. The protocol\u2019s market capitalization now stands at $5.42 billion, ranking it 23rd overall in the market.\n\nNEAR price projected to rise.

Key Factors To Consider, According To Analysts\n2 weeks ago\nPrice Forecast Indicates Rebound Potential\n\nThe medium-term prognosis for NEAR is predominantly favorable. Technical analysis forecasts an upward trend in the forthcoming seven days, with the token presently trading 220% beneath its projected value for the subsequent month. During a three-month interval, the price is anticipated to rise by 240%, indicative of favorable market sentiment and heightened adoption.\n\nProlonged projections are similarly positive, with a six-month growth anticipated at 178% and a one-year projection indicating a 165% increase. Although short-term price fluctuations may indicate general market instability, the long-term prospects for NEAR are clear. Investors must keep tabs of forthcoming ecosystem advancements and AI trends to assess the protocol\u2019s price trajectory.\n\nFeatured image from Pexels, chart from Avark",

        "article": "Aptos and Near Protocol have each made strong cases as investment opportunities this year. Both have, after all, made significant strides in 2024. However, their large market cap limits their potential upside to a maximum of 2x to 10x under the most bullish conditions. Investors looking for real gains will find it in opportunities that haven\u2019t scratched the surface of their moon potential just yet. Well, that opportunity has arrived with the launch of revenue-sharing DeFi protocol Zig Network (ZIG). Learn why analysts believe Zig Network will outperform both Aptos and Near Protocol in 2024 and beyond.\n\nAptos catches fire\n\nAptos is on a hot streak as October draws to an end. The Layer-1 blockchain protocol has turned in a 69% gain in the past month, no doubt delighting Aptos holders who held through the year\u2019s lows. This indicates a strong bullish sentiment among traders. However, investors looking to get in on the gains will have already been late. Although there is yet some upside for Aptos, its potential is handicapped by its $5 billion market cap.\n\nNear Protocol settles at a comfy range\n\nNear Protocol had been fluctuating wildly between $3 and $6 in previous months. However, as the year draws to an end, Near Protocol prices have settled in at a comfy $5. As of press time, Near Protocol has recorded an 18.8% gain in the past month, despite struggling to hold on to the momentum it had gained earlier this year. But much like Aptos, Near Protocol has already pumped hard and sits at a $5.9 billion market cap, limiting its potential to pump hard.\n\nZig Network tipped for big-time gains in 2024 and beyond\n\nThe smart money knows that the real profits to be made are in low-cap gems with the backing, the fundamentals, and the value proposition to go on a meteoric run instead of tokens that have already mooned. This is why analysts believe revenue-sharing DeFi newcomer Zig Network is better positioned to turn in biblical gains in 2024 and beyond than Aptos or Near Protocol.\n\nZig Network, for one, has timed its launch perfectly just as DeFi begins winding up for a massive resurgence and Zig Network is expected to be one of the key players in the future of the emerging DeFi ecosystem. Simplifying the DeFi experience by enabling users to stake, farm yield, and generate passive income through its simple interface, Zig Network could serve as the bulwark from whence millions and millions of new Web3 users can be onboarded.\n\nThat means its $ZIG token could be the beneficiary of a major pump one that could go upwards of 100x. With tokens at just $0.01 during stage 1 of the launch, now is the best time to join the Zig Network presale.\n\nTo find out more about the Zig Network presale use the links below:\nParticipate in the Zig Network Presale\nRead the Zignet Whitepaper\n\n\u00a0\n\nDisclaimer:\u00a0This is a paid release.

        "article": "Recently, both Near Protocol and Tron have shown differing performances, drawing attention. Near Protocol\u2019s trading environment remains lively despite recent declines, suggesting a possible rebound to its all-time high. Concurrently, the Tron (TRX) price has exhibited remarkable stability, symbolizing a steady ascent amid a fluctuating market.\n\nUnlike others, BlockDAG is experiencing a standout phase. It swiftly amassed $4 million in a single day, totaling a staggering over $90 million so far. This overwhelming interest has placed BlockDAG among the most successful presale ever, hinting at a potential surge in the value of BDAG coins in future batches.\n\nExploring Near Protocol\u2019s Market Movements\n\nNear Protocol has sparked discussions lately, especially after notable price shifts in September. Initially dropping 10% to $4.92, it has since experienced a 65% boost in daily trading volume, maintaining optimism about its future.\n\nMarket analysts speculate that Near Protocol could revisit its previous highs, potentially reaching its all-time high again. While a short-term surge to $52 seems ambitious, the token has achieved significant peaks before. Although these are merely projections, the sustained interest in Near Protocol highlights its ongoing relevance.\n\nTron (TRX) Price Stability Amid Growth\n\nIn early October, the TRON Network declared a record $577 million in third-quarter revenue for 2024, marking a 43% increase from the last period. Yet, the Tron (TRX) price has stayed stable, averaging around $0.15.\n\nThis period of solid financial results paired with price stability suggests a consolidation phase. The minimal growth rate of 0.46% over the month, alongside neutral market sentiments reflected in RSI and ADX, indicates little immediate price movement for Tron (TRX).\n\nBlockDAG Soars to Nearly $90M, Gaining $10M in Just 72 Hours\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s presale trajectory has been meteoric, a phenomenon rarely seen in the cryptocurrency sphere. It managed to amass an impressive $10 million within 72 hours, skyrocketing its cumulative total to over $90 million. This exceptional rise has sparked conversations among crypto enthusiasts and analysts alike, wondering if BlockDAG might echo the storied post-launch ascendancy of Bitcoin.\n\nThis remarkable surge transcends mere presale figures. Since the onset of 2024, strategic partnerships and a well-received testnet launch have significantly raised BlockDAG\u2019s profile, attracting assets from prominent Bitcoin holders. This influx of heavyweight backers has not only elevated market confidence but also broadened the appeal of BDAG coins, fueling an increase in demand.\n\nPrice evolution from the initial to the twenty-third batch reflects this burgeoning interest, with the coin\u2019s value climbing to $0.0206, delivering a staggering 1960% return to early backers. This continuing price appreciation is capturing the attention of the global crypto community, signaling a vibrant market trend.\n\nFor those considering a foray into the crypto market, now presents a prime opportunity. With 13.8 billion coins already distributed, there remains a potential for significant gains. Engaging now offers a chance to ride this financial wave, capitalizing on BDAG coins\u2019 current low prices, which are projected to rise with ongoing market momentum.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWrapping up the top cryptocurrency options, here\u2019s a quick comparison of three noteworthy coins. Near Protocol shows potential for significant returns despite recent price fluctuations, suggesting it might reach its all-time high again. Tron (TRX) is notable for its stability, with steady, minor growth.\n\nIn contrast, BlockDAG truly leads, having raised over $90 million. This considerable demand indicates that its value could see substantial increases in future presale batches, making it a compelling option for those looking to participate.\n\nDiscover More About BlockDAG:\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\n\nDisclaimer:\u00a0This is a paid release.
